# @param log_filename: path to the log file to read from and cluster
# param separator: character to tokenize log statements by.
# param threshold_1: percentage value 0 < x < 1 that determines the percentage of tokens in a log statement
#                    that should be equal to corresponding tokens in order to cluster. For example, a value of
#                    0.5 states that 50% of tokens of a log statement should equal the tokens of another to cluster.
# param threshold_2: percentage value 0 < x < 1 that determines the percentage of tokens in a log statement that should
#                    be similar to corresponding tokens in order to merge clusters. For example, a value of 0.5 states
